Start coding a react application

> If you are working locally instead of using codespaces or gitpod, please follow [local installation steps](#local-installation-skip-if-you-are-working-on-codespaces-or-gitpod) and come back to this part of the readme.

## How to start coding?

- Install the packages with `$ npm install`.
- Run the webpack server with `$ npm run start`

You can update the `styles/index.css` or `js/index.js` depending on your needs.
